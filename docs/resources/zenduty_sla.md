# Resource : zenduty_sla 
Provides a Zenduty SLAs Resource. This allows SLAs to be created, updated, and deleted.    
## Example Usage
```hcl
resource "zenduty_teams" "exampleteam" {
  name = "exmaple team"
}

data "zenduty_user" "user1" {
  email = "demouser@gmail.com"
}
```

```hcl

resource "zenduty_sla" "example_sla" {
  name             = "demo sla"
  description      = "this is a demo sla"
  team_id          = zenduty_teams.exampleteam.id
  acknowledge_time = 5
  resolve_time     = 10
  escalations {
    time = 30
    type = 1
    responders {
      user = data.zenduty_user.user1.users[0].username
    }
  }
  escalations {
    time = -10
    type = 2
    responders {
      user = data.zenduty_user.user1.users[0].username
    }
  }
}

```


## Argument Reference

* `team_id` - (Required) The unique_id of team to create the sla in.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the sla.
* `description`  - (Required) The description of the sla
* `acknowledge_time` - (Required) time in seconds to trigger SLA if not acknowledged.
* `resolve_time` - (Required) Time in seconds to trigger SLA if not resolved.
* `escalations` - (Required) Reminders when an SLA is breached or about to breach.  (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--escalation))

```hcl

escalations {
    time = 30
    type = 1
    responders {
      user = data.zenduty_user.user1.users[0].username
    }
  }

```

<a id="nestedblock--escalation"></a>

* `type`: It is an integer field that determines the type of notification behavior. `1` signifies that notifications are sent when the SLA breach is acknowledged, while `2` indicates notifications for resolution SLA breaches.
* `time`: This field specifies the time duration in seconds when notifications should be sent. If time is positive, it means notifications will be sent x seconds after the SLA breach, and if it's negative, notifications will be sent x seconds before the breach.
* `responders` - users who need to be paged when an SLA is breached. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--responders))


<a id="nestedblock--responders"></a>

```hcl
responders {
    user = data.zenduty_user.user1.users[0].username
}
```
* `user` - Username of the user who will be notified if sla is breached 






## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Zenduty SlA.

## Import

Team SLAs can be imported using the `team_id`(ie. unique_id of the team) and `sla_id`(ie. unique_id of the sla), e.g.

```hcl
resource "zenduty_sla" "sla1" {


}
```

`$ terraform import zenduty_sla.sla1 team_id/sla_id` 

`$ terraform state show zenduty_sla.sla1`

`* copy the output data and paste inside zenduty_sla.sla1 resource block and remove the id attribute`

`$ terraform plan` to verify the import
